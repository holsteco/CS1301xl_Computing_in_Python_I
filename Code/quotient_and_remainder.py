#The code below tries to calculate the quotient and remainder
#of a pair of numbers. However, right now None is printing
#in several places throughout the code's execution. Fix the
#code so that it behaves as intended: it should print the
#quotient, remainder, then the message, "We're done!"
#
#HINT: There are a couple ways to do this, and some of those
#ways might be a little advanced right now. Note that 17 // 6
#will correctly calculate the quotient and num_1 % num_2 will
#correctly calculate the remainder.
#
#HINT 2: Click Reset to start over from scratch.

num_1 = 17
num_2 = 6

quotient = num_1 // num_2
print("The quotient is", quotient)

remainder =  num_1 % num_2
print("The remainder is", remainder)

print("We're done!")
